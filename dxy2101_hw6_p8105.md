```

## Problem 2

Load and prepare homicide data.

``` r
# Load data
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv'

homicide_data = read_csv(url)

# Create new variables and clean
homicide_data =
  homicide_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         status = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
         )) %>%
  select(-city, -state, -disposition) %>%
  relocate(city_state, .before = lat) %>%
  subset(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ"
         & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```
